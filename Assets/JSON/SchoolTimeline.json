In 10th grade, I chose programming as an elective subject and that is when I got a good taste for programming. Here I got familiar with coding in Python and Scratch.",

In the media portion, I got familiar with some Adobe programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. We also had some projects involving some media production sets. In the second year, I picked IT, where I got more in-depth with the IT part. More databases, C#, networking, and user support.",
